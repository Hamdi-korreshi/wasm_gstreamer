# This is a project im doing over winter break.

So far, there is a generic adjacency matrix graph implementation in graph.h. I'm used it to start creating a browser-based UI that will allow the user to define a gstreamer pipeline in browser. Hopefully the genericity of this implementation will make it possible to incorporate the gstreamer functions into it later. Probably by shoving function pointers into the vertices.
