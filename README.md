# This is a project im doing over winter break.

So far, there is a generic bitwise adjacency matrix graph implementation in graph.h. (1 edge = 1 bit). I'm about to use it to create a browser-based UI that will allow the user to define a gstreamer pipeline in browser. Hopefully the genericity of this implementation will make it possible to incorporate the gstreamer functions into it later. Probably by shoving function pointers into the vertices.
